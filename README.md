# Adult-Salaries-Prediction-DL
# Adult Salaries Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use Python libraries to analyze the Adult Salaries dataset. The notebook includes code for data exploration, data preprocessing, and data visualization.

Dataset

The Adult Salaries dataset is a collection of census data from the 1990s. The dataset includes information on the following attributes:

Age: Age of the individual in years
Workclass: Type of work the individual performs
fnlwgt: Final weight
Education: Level of education of the individual
Education_Num: Numerical representation of education level
Marital_Status: Marital status of the individual
Occupation: Occupation of the individual
Relationship: Relationship of the individual to the householder
Race: Race of the individual
Sex: Sex of the individual
Capital_Gain: Capital gains of the individual
Capital_Loss: Capital losses of the individual
Hours_per_week: Number of hours worked per week
Native_Country: Native country of the individual
Salary: Salary of the individual
Notebook

The Jupyter notebook included in this repository contains the following sections:

Data exploration: This section explores the data using various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.
Data preprocessing: This section preprocesses the data by removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.
Data visualization: This section visualizes the preprocessed data using various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.
Results

The results of the data analysis show that there are several factors that are correlated with salary, including age, education level, occupation, and hours worked per week. The results also show that there is a gender gap in salaries, with men earning more than women on average.

Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates how to use Python libraries to analyze the Adult Salaries dataset. The results of the data analysis show that there are several factors that are correlated with salary, including age, education level, occupation, and hours worked per week. The results also show that there is a gender gap in salaries, with men earning more than women on average. This information can be used to inform policy decisions and to develop programs to address the gender gap in salaries.
